A flutter flame project I created for CoDev

## Criteria

### Screen Interaction

- [x] The player should be able to create a small ball by clicking on the screen.

### Ball Behavior

- [x] Upon clicking the screen, a new ball should spawn at the click location and
move in a random direction.
- [x] ~~Balls should move at a constant speed.~~ (_edit: I misunderstood this, hoping current implementation is acceptable. Will update the repository in earliest free time_)

### Collisions

- [x] If two balls collide, both should change their direction to the opposite.

- [x] Collision detection should work correctly even with multiple balls on the
screen.

### Removing Balls

- [x] If a ball moves outside the screen, it should be removed from the game.
